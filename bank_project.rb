# The balance=100 is signifying an optional parameter. Ruby is saying that you can pass one or two 
# arguments to initialize; if you pass two, it uses your balance argument to set @balance; 
# if you only pass a name, balance gets a default value of 100, and that's what gets stored in @balance.
#
# We used underscores in our 1_000_000 (one million). 
# Ruby allows this, and it makes it easier to read big numbers!
